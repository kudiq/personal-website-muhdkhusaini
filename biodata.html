        My name is Muhammad Khusaini Bin Zamzi and I am one of the students at UiTM Rembau Campus. I have five siblings and 
        I am the second child as well as I also have twin brothers. I was born on 15 June 2001.
        I am better known as Kudiq and my family as well as friends always call that name to me.

        I have a lot of hobbies that I love to do in my spare time. Usually I would jog every evening with my friends for a
         jog around the lake park near my house. At other times I also like to play badminton on the Live Sports court where it provides a comfortable badminton space. 
         Live Sports also gives a cheap price if I use or show my student card.

            At first I lived in Kuala Terengganu for 3 years in the police quarters. I moved to Pantai Dalam, Kuala Lumpur when I was 4 years old and started studying there. 
            I attended primary school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Bandaraya for a year and moved to Bandar Baru Bangi. I continued my studies at Sekolah Kebangsaan Jalan Tiga. 
            I also connected high school at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Jalan Tiga.
